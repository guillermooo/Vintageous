TIGERS
------

Tigers are the largest members of the felid species. They are wild and
dangerous. Vintageous, on the other hand, is an open source project.
Developing Vintageous is hard work. If it helps you, please consider donating.

I'm the creator and main author of Vintageous, but some generous people have
contributed their time and effort as well. See the more active ones here; you
may want to show them some gratitude too:

Thanks for reading and for using Vintageous!

(No tigers were harmed during the making of Vintageous.)
